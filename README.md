cloudify-drivers
================
Contains 2 modules for openstack essex and vsphere drivers for
cloudify 2.1.0 (http://cloudifysource.org)
Has been tested with openstack essex and vSphere 5.0.
To compile the vSphere driver download vijava from http://vijava.sourceforge.net and
add it as a maven artifact under com/vmware/vijava/2.5

This code needs to and will be merged with the original cloudifysource at some point(I have sent the code
to them as well ) but right now it is as is .
Known Issues
============
The vSphere driver fails to terminate the instances at some point
